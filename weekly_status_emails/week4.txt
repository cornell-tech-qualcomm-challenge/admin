Hi Anand, 

Please find our weekly update below. 

Progress for this week (9/18-9/24):

Our meeting on Tuesday was very fruitful.  The highlights our below :

AR business card has two insurmountable stumbling blocks that came out in our smile tests  : 
     Interactions will seem fake and somewhat forced. 
     Scanning peoples faces will not work if we have to utilize a phone. Google glass is better supported for this.

Credibility in journalism is a major problem and we recognized certain characteristics that can be used to measure it:
     Number of articles written about within a particular topic. 
     Sentiment analysis of the comments belonging to that article. 
     Credibility of coauthors the journalist works with on a particular topic (measured by these three points). 

Developed an architecture diagram for what this would look like
Conducted a shallow feasibility study for whether this would work (i.e. identified elements of our software stack)

Plans for next week (9/25-10/1):
Plan and execute a call with you to get your feedback on our new idea
Develop a pitch deck for our 'crit event' - an event where we pitch our idea to be critiqued 
More in-depth analysis of feasibility (i.e. what portion of this processing can be handled locally on the phone and how much needs to be pushed to the cloud). 
Plan and execute a call with Arnaud Sahuguet to get your feedback on our new idea

Potential Risks:
Require CSP agreement signed
We may have to position this more of a feature within NYT reader versus a product by itself. 

Thank you,
Team Qualcomm
