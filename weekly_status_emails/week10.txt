Hi Anand, 

Thanks again for the call last week. The team is excited with the direction we are moving in!

Please find our weekly update below. 

Progress for this week (10/30-11/05):
Completed our second crit session where professionals in industry provided us feedback on our product. Please find those here.
Narrowed down our domain towards academia. Build out our network of credibility using academic papers and linking authors to the papers they reference. 
Started development of the credibility scoring algorithm which you can see here 
For example,  for 10 authors (marked by 0-9 key values) within the blockchain topic we can generate these relative scores : {0: 0.50902821656473674, 1: 0.48676598454587383, 2: 0.74990614482307083, 3: 0.67845799296422804, 4: 0.33410090213481264, 5: 0.32250912967505019, 6: 0.5752200375053016, 7: 0.42797709292693698, 8: 0.58175768688763618, 9: 0.32320539477201943}    

Plans for next week (11/06-11/12):
Index information from the  database of academic papers - i.e. write out our script to collect information and store
Further develop the scoring algorithm in parallel 
Start looking at ways in which our product can enter other domains as well as our strategy for generating revenue. 

Potential Risks:

We do not have a clear idea of how our user interface will fit into this. Do we want to overlay on existing articles (like a chrome extension) or do we want to be a separate platform that provides in depth stats to our users regarding their  value in the network.  
Interesting link of the week : Check out CORE - Online aggregator of open source research docs

Thank you,
