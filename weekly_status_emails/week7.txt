 Anand, 
We hope you had a great weekend!

Please find our weekly update below. 

Progress for this week (10/9-10/15):
We conducted our second sprint and built a small prototype to demonstrate our narrative complete product (NCP). You can find our presentation here 
We solidified the mechanics of our backend and would love to present this to you at our next call. 
We also wrestled with another concept that utilizes a newsreader's/ article reader's social network to recommend connections you have that may be experts (relative to you) at the topic you are currently reading about.

Plans for next week (10/16-10/22):
Meeting with our studio professor on Tuesday to update and validate
We would love to get your opinion on two things this week
Our progress on our NCP - backend architecture  as well as the user experience
The second idea we wrestled with at sprint.
 Now that we have a prototype, we would like to have people interact with it to gain more relevant feedback 

Potential Risks:

Our prototype scratches the surface of the scope of our project. We may need to revisit our scope and redefine the product to target a specific type of news / specific type of demographic. 

Thank you,
Team Qualcomm
