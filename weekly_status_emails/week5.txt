Hi Anand, 

Thanks again for your time on Thursday. It really helped us to hear your views. 
Please find our weekly update below. 

Progress for this week (9/25-10/1):
Created script to begin dumping metadata for NYT journalists 
Spoke with our advisor, Hannah Donovan, who helped us narrow in on a more detailed narrative
Our narrative: "As a reader I can extract information about a journalist so that I can have a more informed (well rounded) opinion on any given topic"
Create user interviews to gain more insight into whether people would utilise this product or not. You can find our results here   

Plans for next week (10/2-10/8):
Create our pitch deck for crit
Plan and execute a call with Arnaud Sahuguet to get feedback on our new idea. 
Design user experiment to mimic a situation where a user is asked to identify fake news before and after being exposed to information about the journalist. This will help provide insight into how a user debunks an article as well as which information is important in order for them to be able to do so.
Potential Risks:
NYTs data may not have enough instances of journalists that lack credibility in a certain topic.

Thank you,
Team Qualcomm
