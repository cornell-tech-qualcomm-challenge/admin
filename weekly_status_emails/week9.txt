 Anand, 

We hope you are doing well!
Please find our weekly update below. 

Progress for this week (10/23-10/29):
Consumer journey from introduction to exit with the 5 E's framework. It has helped us get down to thinking about things at a much more granular level. You can find this here
Created tech talk presentation to be able to present at our next crit session. Dives deeper into our narrative as well as tech stack. You can find this here
We have reworded our narrative to reflect (more pointedly) what our product is and the problem that it solves. See tech talk slides.

Plans for next week (10/30-11/05):
We have another crit session where alumni in industry will provide us feedback. 
Arrange a call with you to inform you of our weekly deliverables from here till the end of the semester. 
Delegating someone to be design lead on this product and to begin educating themselves 

Potential Risks:

With the amount of screen real estate we need to ensure that our design is not too cluttered. We want to provide a lot of functionality and we may not have the real estate to do so beautifully.
