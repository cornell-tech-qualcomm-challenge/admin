 Anand, 

At the end of this week , Team Qualcomm will be participating in its first sprint. We will devote a major portion of the day, devoid of other distractions, to working on our product. Our goal for the sprint is to pick a feature of our product and develop a working prototype. 

Progress for this week (9/4-9/10):
Conducted meeting with you to inform you about our ideas and have them vetted 
Defined long term goal of working prototype by the end of the semester
Updated our system diagrams to include new developments in our thought
Created narratives to help portray our softwares usage
Plans for next week (9/11-9/17):
Meet on Wednesday to narrow our focus further and set goals for our sprint
Our first sprint at the end of this week after which we will create a presentation to share with you 
Meet with our advisor (Hannah Donovan) on Thursday to gain insight on our progress so far 
Send out our CSP agreements in order for you to sign them. 
Potential Risks:
Creating a small enough task to be able to tackle at our first sprint 
Failing to define the scope of our product quick enough which may leave us struggling at the end of the semester.  
We will keep you updated of our progress after the sprint!

Thank you,
Team Qualcomm
