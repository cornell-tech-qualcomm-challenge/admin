Hi Anand, 

Please find our weekly update below. 

Progress for this week (9/25-10/1):
Our pitch deck for our crit presentations can be found here 
Along with this we made an iteration on our product loop (We will keep iterating on this deck in the future)
We have taken the findings from crit and are more confident with the type of user experiment we want to run. You can find our findings here 

Plans for next week (10/2-10/8):
Prepare for sprint 2 which is this Thursday/Friday. This means :
Preparing and Conducting our user experiments 
Designing prototype to demonstrate functionality of our software
Solidifying our means of content delivery (i.e. app, browser etc.)
Potential Risks:
Our user experiments could show a lack of interest in which case we will need to pivot once again.

Thank you,
Team Qualcomm
