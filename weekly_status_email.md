> Not sure what to write? Its in the wiki https://github.com/cornelltech/studio/wiki/Professionalism

Weekly status reports are concise emails that give stakeholders an overview of the current state of your Product Studio or Startup Studio project. Per your team's development process, these emails are typically sent on Mondays to all stakeholder, such as the Company Champion in Product Studio, your class list, and everyone on your team. Status reports should cover the following:

### Week behind
Summarize the progress you made during the week. What meaningful progress did you make?

### Week ahead
Summarize your plans for the upcoming week. What meaningful progress do you plan to make?

### Risks
Call out any current risks, challenges, and blockers. What are you doing to address these risks?
